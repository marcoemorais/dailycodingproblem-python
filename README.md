# dailycodingproblem-python

This repo contains jupyter notebooks with my solutions to exercises from _Daily Coding Problem_ by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu <cite data-cite="miller2019daily">(Miller and Wu, 2019)</cite>.  In many cases, the solution described in the book is similar to the approach I used when solving each problem, but my intent was not to reproduce the solutions from the book verbatim.  Instead I solved each problem before looking at the solution in the book and only made revisions if I found my solution to be substantially inferior.
